# data-science-competition-gelar-rasa
In this competition, we were provided with two main datasets:
 1. Sales Dataset

    For this dataset, we were tasked with conducting visualization and descriptive analysis. To accomplish this, we utilized Tableau as the primary tool for data visualization.

 3. Fraud Dataset
    
    For this dataset, we were required to perform modeling by comparing three types of models: regression, classification, and clustering.
    
     • Regression:
     
      Among the five regression models compared, the CatBoost Regressor was selected as the best regression model, achieving an RMSE of 0.12 and an R² score of 0.84.
      
     • Classification:
     
      For classification tasks, we compared three classification algorithms, with the XGBoost Classifier emerging as the best model, achieving an accuracy of 0.98.
      
     • Clustering:
     
      In clustering tasks, we compared three clustering algorithms. The Hierarchical Single Linkage model was chosen as the best clustering model, with a silhouette score of 0.91. Additionally, we utilized the K-Best method for feature selection.
